# Scatterplot matrix to identify correlated variables with sales
pairs(cigdata[,-1], pch = 19, panel=panel.smooth)

*Highest sales state: NH; lowest sales state: UT *
*From the scatterplot, I think correlated variables with sales are age, income and price*

# Multiple linear regression
lmd<- lm(Sales~Age+HS+Income+Black+Female+Price, data=cigdata)
summary(lmd)

*I didn't take state into the multiple linear regression model since it is a factor varaible.*
*Summary of the fit: RSE of the model is 28.17 on 44 degrees of freedom, which is not a small number. 
The quality of a linear regression seems not so fit. The p-value is 0.006857, which is larger than 5%, 
therefore the linear model is not going to be statistically significant. Multiple R-Squared and 
Adjusted R-squared would be higher(> 0.70) the better, the value is low for the model.*

summary(lmd) # find coefficients of price

*The coefficient of price in the linear regression model is -3.25492, 
so when the price goes up by a dollar per carton, 
sales will drop 3.25492 if other variables remain the same.*

mean(cigdata[,"Female"])

*The mean of female buyers in those states is 50.95098, which is more than 50%, so females buy more cigarette in all.*
