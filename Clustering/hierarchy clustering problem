## We need to scale the data in order to standardize the variables. 
## For example, the scale of energy, protein, fat, calcium and iron are different, 
## for having better understanding of proportion of between variables, it is better to scale data.


# Create various dendrograms using single, complete, and average linkage

# Single-linkage clustering of the nutrient data

# Average-linkage clustering of the nutrient data

# Cut the dendrogram into groups of 5

# Single linkage

# Complete linkage
grp2 <- cutree(hc2, k = 5)
# Average linkage
grp3 <- cutree(hc3, k = 5)


# Describes clusters by single linkage method
sing <- aggregate(newnutri, by = list(cluster = grp1), median)

# Describes clusters by complete linkage method

## The results show that different methods in hierarchical clustering generate 5 different groups. 
## The group median of complete and average methods are the same. With scaled data and their median, 
## we could have better understanding of the composition of those nutrition variables.

## Discuss the common nutrient characteristics in each group. Among three methods, Beef heart/Sardnies canned/Clams raw 
## and clams canned are always singleton. Take average linkage clustering for example: Beef heart is high in protein and 
## iron. Sardnies canned has much higher in calcium than the other food groups. The clam cluster(clams raw and clams canned) 
##is low in protein and high in iron. The group (beef roast to pork simmered) are high in energy and fat compared to other 
## groups. The largest group (mackerel to bluefish) is relatively low in iron.
