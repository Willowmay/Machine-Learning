Clustering Algorithms 


1. KMEAN Clustering Problem

We will cluster the iris dataset to understand the structure of dataset via the already designed function so-called kmeans(). We also will design a program to visually determine the number of clusters.


2. Hierarchy Clustering Problem

The nutrient dataset contains the measurements of nutrients in several types of meat, fish, and fowl. We can characterize the nutrients of types of food. In this practice, we are going to group the food by the common nutrient characteristics than the type of food using the Hierarchy Clustering method, hclust() and cutree() functions.
