# Machine-Learning

In 2018 summer, I finished machine learning class in Columbia University successfully with the highest score in my class. 
A year ago, I am a new student with zero programming knowledge, but now I feel very comfortable with data and always be
suprised by looking into history data will shed light on impactful future.

There is a saying from movie Man of Steel, "People are afraid of what they don't understand". 
At the beginning it happened to me. However, I felt more and more confident after I kept learning and exercising.
I have always been fascinated with interesting things, and would willing to try confidently to understand why and get solutions. 
That is how I start.

Hope my machine learning project and experience of learning would be helpful for you! 

For any further inquiry, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. 

Thanks!
