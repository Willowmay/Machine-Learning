# Machine-Learning

In 2018 summer, I finished machine learning course at Columbia University successfully with the highest score in class. 

A year ago, I am a new student with little programming knowledge, but now I feel very comfortable with data and always be
suprised by looking into history data will shed light on new impactful thoughts.

It covers most commonly used supervised learning algorithms and standard techniques to improve classifier performance, as I shared here, which also introduces modern deep learning techniques. 

I use various methods of feature extraction, algorithms, model building, assessment of efficacy of models and it will emphasize applications to real data.

Hope my machine learning project and experience of learning would be helpful for you! 

For any further inquiry, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. 

Thanks!
