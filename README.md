# Machine-Learning


One year ago, I am a new student with little programming knowledge, but now I feel very comfortable with data and always be
suprised by looking into history data will shed light on new impactful thoughts. 2018 summer, I finished machine learning course at Columbia University successfully with the highest score in class. 

This repository covers most commonly used supervised learning algorithms and standard techniques to improve classifier performance, as I shared here, which also introduces modern deep learning techniques:

Supervised Learning – k-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression

Clustering

Perception and Logistic Regression

Classification: Discriminant Analyses and Naïve Bayes

Resampling Methods for Model Assessment and Selection

Regularized Regression and Decision Trees

Bagging, Random Forests, and Boosting

Support Vector Machines

Neural Networks

Deep Learning – Convolutional Neural Networks


I used various methods of feature extraction, algorithms, model building, assessment of efficacy of models and it will emphasize applications to real data.

Hope my machine learning project and experience of learning would be helpful for you! 

For any further inquiry, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. 

Thanks!
